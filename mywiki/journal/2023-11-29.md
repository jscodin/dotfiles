Tried to get wiki.vim installed, took me all evening pretty much

Documentation non-existent on how to get it working inside of lazyvim, I realise this may be a niche issue?

Anywhoo, seem to have some of the functionality working which is the main thing, however for some reason cannot use the default mapping that opens the index.md file which is very odd as it appears the rest of the key maps seem to work fine (only tried a handful so far, including getting into this journal).

On another note, did manage to finish off my thoughts on how the array.reduce method worked, so that wasn't too bad.

Managed to get it put into my first wiki page, feel like I finally understand the reduce method after typing it out, will try to do this more often. Need to figure out how best to link pages, but i think that will come with time

Will see how consistent I can be with this journal too, will only be coding related, see how i get on with my journey up-skilling myself in this new area.

I will be successful!
