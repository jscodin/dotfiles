Today has not been as productive as I would have liked tbh

This evening (can only code in the evening of course) I was supposed to be making a lot of progress on the calculator project

I mean i got the files set up and the repo up on github, got the basic functions set up etc.

But just wanted to at least get some stuff done on the html side too, but got let my annoyance of autoformatting get the better of me lol

Anyway spent over an hour trying to debug this issue where lazyvim autoformats on save, and it was driving me crazy only in html files, however found a solution after midnight..

Guess I'll try again tomorrow and try harder to ignore the little things annoying me, cannot keep getting distractred, cannot afford it 
Tomorrow will get some resemblance of buttons on the page and hopefully make a little headway, maybe leave the logic for a tad bit
