So tonight went much better than last evening, even if i spent an hour or so watching netflix...(Jen)

Managed to stay away from rabbit holes and focus on creating the visual part of the calculator

Reminded myself how difficult it is to center an element lol, however calculator is visual now and has buttons and a display even

Quite pleased, though it took a little bit longer than it should have done, and i am now up past 1am again, which is not good..

Anyhow well done Josh, will review tomorrow evening and see what i should work on next, might need to refactor code a lil bit to add classes and maybe types? for the buttons

Success and positivity! You will achieve your dreams and more
