Sooo tonight has been one of those ones..

However overall today has been very productive coding-wise

Managed to add 3 different functionalities to my calculator, which is pretty cool

Quite proud, if i may say so myself

Want to say i'm maybe nearly half-way through the task, which felt impossible when i first read through it, now that the calculator is taking shape and some buttons are set up and working i feel like this will be done quite soon and i can finally get on to the real serious javascript stuff

anywhoo, well done again Josh, keep up the consistency it will pay off, financial success is on its way, the universe is aligning to achieve your dreams and goals.
