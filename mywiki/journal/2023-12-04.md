well tonight was a waste..

did not make any progress at all, just found a bunch of things that did not work

very frustrating..

Nothing really else to report tonight i guess, was hoping to have figured out how to store the first number and the second number while using the operator to do so, but my mind is probs not in the right place tonight for some reason.. mmhmm you know what

Anywhoo we'll try again tomorrow

You will succeed Josh and become financially successful and abundant!
