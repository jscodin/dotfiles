Well the other night was a wasted evening tbf so i didn't bother creating an entry

Tonight a bit better, found a solution from stack overflow that i'm trying to implement into my current code

However having issue trying to figure out how to keep the same functionality for the second set of numbers after the operator is pressed. Currently the only the first digit is displayed, it seems to console.log ok so maybe need to look into that.

Anyway not as much done tonight as i'm still stuck but im sure i'll figure it out sooner rather than later

As always Josh you will be successful, financially abundant, you will smash this and upskill yourself in good time, trust God's timing bro
